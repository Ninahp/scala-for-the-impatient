# Scala basics  
 
> A typical Scala application can be launched from `sbt`vwithout the need of an IDE or other complex tooling 

+ To create the project we create an empty file under the following diectory structure: 
    ``` 
    myfolder/build.sbt 
    myfolder/src/main
    myfolder/src/main/scala/Basics.scala 
    ``` 
     
+ Under `myfolder` we launch `sbt`:
    ```bash 
    $ sbt compile 
    $ sbt run 
    $ sbt package 
    ```
